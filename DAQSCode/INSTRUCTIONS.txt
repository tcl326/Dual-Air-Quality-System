For any code being made, make a folder in this location with a title that describes what the code is for.

When writing the code, use many comments so others can understand what is going on. Put your initials at the start.

For example:
#WY: This is my comment.

Each time you go and make a revision. Open the file, click save as and save a new file in the same folder named "FILENAME Rn",
where n is the next number in the sequence.

For example:
If a new py file was made by Yara and called Converter.py
If I went in and worked on it, I would open the file and before doing any work, I would save it as "Converter R1.py".
Then if she worked on it later, she would open Converter R1 and click save as, before doing any work under the name "Converter R2.py".
